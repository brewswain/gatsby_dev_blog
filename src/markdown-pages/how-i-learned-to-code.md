# How I decided my learning method for coding

Let's talk about how I learned one of the more useful skills to have competence and confidence in, coding. Before we go into the actual process however, the overarching question that you should first think about before you learn to pick up programming/coding in any way should be simply, "Why? Why would I learn to program instead of other skills?"

Well, let's start with the obvious. Quite simply, there's a huge demand for it! As technology is continuously improving, so too do the needs of consumers, which means a greater need for dedicated developers to provide a solid UX (User Experience) and development as a whole.

That alone is a huge plus, but learning to code also provides the huge benefit of teaching you how to utilize directed and meaningful direction to your thought process to aid in problem solving. After all, you can simply look at programming as a method to solve specific problems that users would wish to be solved.

But finally, and for me the most important reason to learn to code, learning to code teaches you how to learn effectively. Learning to code often leads to you using google to research the technology you're using to solve a problem, most often with you reading that platform's documentation. You're constantly looking for answers, and you're constantly trying to hone your craft, which means that you need to understand how to effectively filter information that's important, especially in our information oversaturated world. In fact, I'd argue that learning how to differentiate information that's pertinent and knowledge that _appears_ pertinent is one of the most effective methods to effectively learning.

## But how exactly do I learn to code without going to University?

---

Well, there are 3 main options that people tend to fixate on:

- Bootcamp
- Books
- Online Course

Each of these approaches offer both advantages and disadvantages to the learning process.

Bootcamps are arguably the most effective self-taught approach if you're aiming to get a job in a big company like Google, but they're expensive, and take away a large part of your day to day; You don't just invest money, but also your time. If you require a structured environment, and you have the ability to not work a typical fulltime job for the time period that the course runs, then this option is great.

But let's say that Bootcamps don't work out for you. Well, if you still need a structured approach, learning to program via books is an excellent option. They often offer the most well thought out path to learning a subject, due to the fact that flow of information is a really important consideration if you're plotting out a book. However, one huge pitfall you have to consider is that usually, the information provided in this book will be outdated, especially in today's world where technology shifts so fast. However, this is still an excellent option for people now learning to code as it provides a great foundation to learning the basics of programming itself, regardless of language.

The final main option that people usually consider is an online course. Just like with books, you need to be careful that you don't partake in an outdated course. However, it should be noted that this often isn't as big a deal since most course creators tend to keep their courses as up to date as possible. Online courses tend to offer the least structure of our choices, but are usually way more affordable than bootcamps while offering more interaction than books while also offering a more visual learning path for those that learn that way.

## The path I chose

---

After researching all of the above, I came to the conclusion that the most optimal path for me was to use a combination of one main programming book, online courses, and online documentation to offer me polish and understanding of more niche features of whatever language I would learn, in that order.

After searching around, it was quickly apparent that Python is a very beginner friendly language to learn the fundamentals of programming with, so I picked up Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. Once I finished that and had an appreciation for the power of Python, I shifted over to a free Online course that taught me Web development by using documentation etc located at https://www.theodinproject.com/ .

So now I had knowledge of Python, as well as a good grasp of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. After learning from there, I made the jump to learn React.JS and multiple other industry standard technologies through another online course, but one that assumed that you understood the basics that i previously outlined. This course was the pretty well known 'Complete React Developer in 2019' by Andrei and Yihua from Udemy.

This leads up to where I am now! My next goal is to learn to build recommender services using python, then use My React skills to provide a website that provides an interface for its users. I'll be using this same method of learning that I've outlined above, as it's very important to have a sense of structure whenever you're learning the fundamentals of a new skill, so I thought I'd share the path I took towards learning how to program.

Just remember however, all paths of learning are valid once you gain knowledge, so find whatever works best for you. Good luck in your learning ventures!
